#### Key Updates
- **Faster Dataset Creation** This method is way faster due to the use of ND-tree-based partitioning and parallel processing.

!!! note "Customizing Your Dataset"
    - **dataset_type**: Defines the type of spatial transcriptomics data. Currently, **xenium** and **merscope** are supported and have been tested.
    - **val_prob, test_prob**: Control the dataset portions for validation and testing. Adjust based on your dataset size and evaluation needs.
    - **frac**: Specifies the fraction of the dataset to process. Reducing `frac` can be useful when working with very large datasets, allowing for faster dataset creation by only processing a subset of the data.

!!! tip "Faster Dataset Creation"
    Increasing the number of workers (`n_workers`) can significantly accelerate the dataset creation process, especially for large datasets, by taking advantage of parallel processing across multiple CPU cores.

!!! tip "Enhancing Segmentation Accuracy with scRNA-seq"
    Incorporating single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data as features can provide additional biological context, improving the accuracy of the segger model.

    - **batch_size**: A larger batch size can speed up training, but requires more memory. Adjust based on your hardware capabilities.
    - **epochs**: Increasing the number of epochs can improve model performance by allowing more learning cycles, but it will also extend the overall training time. Balance this based on your time constraints and hardware capacity.

!!! warning "Ensure Correct CUDA and PyTorch Setup"
    Before using the `--accelerator cuda` flag, ensure your system has CUDA installed and configured correctly. Also, check that the installed CUDA version is compatible with your PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric versions.

### 4. Running the Entire Pipeline

The `submit_job.py` script allows you to run the complete Segger pipeline or specific stages like dataset creation, training, or prediction. The pipeline execution is determined by the configuration provided in a YAML file, supporting various environments like Docker, Singularity, and HPC systems (with LSF, Slurm support is planned).

#### Selecting Pipelines
You can run the three stagesâ€”dataset creation, training, and predictionâ€”sequentially or independently by specifying the pipelines in the YAML configuration file:

    - `1` for dataset creation
    - `2` for model training
    - `3` for prediction

This allows you to run the full pipeline or just specific steps. Set the desired stages under the pipelines field in your YAML file.

#### Running the Pipeline

Use the following command to run the pipeline:

```console
python3 submit_job.py --config_file=filename.yaml
```

- If no `--config_file` is provided, the default `config.yaml` file will be used.

### 5. Containerization

For users who want a portable, containerized environment, segger supports both Docker and Singularity containers. These containers provide a consistent runtime environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

#### Using Docker

You can pull the segger Docker image from Docker Hub with this command:

```console
docker pull danielunyi42/segger_dev:cuda121
```

To run the pipeline in Docker, make sure your YAML configuration includes the following settings:

- `use_singularity`: false
- `use_lsf`: false

Afterwards, run the pipeline inside the Docker container with the same `submit_job.py` command.

#### Using Singularity
For a Singularity environment, pull the image with:

```console
singularity pull docker://danielunyi42/segger_dev:cuda121
```

Ensure `use_singularity: true` in the YAML file and specify the Singularity image file (e.g., `segger_dev_latest.sif`) in the `singularity_image` field.

!!! note "Containerization"
    - The segger Docker image currently supports CUDA 11.8 and CUDA 12.1.

### 6. HPC Environments

Segger also supports HPC environments with LSF job scheduling. To run the pipeline on an HPC cluster using LSF, set `use_lsf: true` in your YAML configuration.

If your HPC system supports Slurm, a similar setup is planned and will be introduced soon.
