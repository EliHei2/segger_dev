# Why segger?

### **Challenges in Segmentation**

Spatial omics segmentation faces issues like:

- **Over/Under-segmentation**
- **Transcript contamination**
- **Scalability limitations**

segger tackles these with a **graph-based approach**, achieving superior segmentation accuracy.

# How segger Works

### **Heterogeneous Graph Structure**

segger models **nuclei and transcript relationships** using:

- **Nodes** for nuclei and transcripts
- **Edges** connecting spatially related elements
- **GNN** to propagate information and refine cell borders

**Nucleus-free transcripts**: segger can effectively handle **nucleus-free cells**, improving transcript assignment in complex tissue environments.
